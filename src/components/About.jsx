            In my career to date, I've navigated diverse industries, honing my skills in problem-solving and creative thinking. My journey, from optimising ATM maintenance at RBS to shaping students' growth as a primary school teacher, has fueled my passion for development. Now fully immersed in my career as a developer, I bring a growth mindset and leadership experience.

            My commitment to excellence extends beyond coding â€“ I've excelled in communication, organisational prowess, and professional development. As a former teacher, I bring a reflective and dynamic work ethic, consistently delivering innovative solutions. With a keen eye for efficiency and an engaging approach, I thrive in collaborative environments. I am not just a developer; I am a dedicated professional who brings a wealth of skills and a passion for impactful and creative work.

            Outside of my professional life, I enjoy DJing and fine dining. I also love all things football: I have had a Crystal Palace season ticket for many years now, and I enjoy playing online fantasy football with friends.
